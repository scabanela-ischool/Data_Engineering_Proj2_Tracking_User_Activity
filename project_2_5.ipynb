    "Based on initial inspection of the sample customer data from Peak Deliveries, I recommend that we continue to withhold the customer data from 3rd party sales channels. This is because I was able to perform data cleansing that rendered the Peak customer data satisfactory for data analysis. The data cleansing process revealed the following characteristics of the Peak customer data, which I will go into more detail:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "Since AGM does not want to give its customer list to 3rd party channels, we expected some variation in customer first names, last names, and street. We verified that the remaining columns including city, state, and zip code are valid for Peak customer records by checking them against AGM’s `zip_codes` table. We confirmed that each city, state, zip combination from Peak Deliveries matches the corresponding AGM zip codes. That is, the number of invalid Peak customer rows is zero."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Our findings on the initial Peak Delivery data has shown that with some data cleansing, the Peak Delivery customer data is acceptable for performaing data analysis. The Peak data exhibited the following during the cleansing process: it passed validation against AGM's `zip_codes` table, there were no duplicate records, there were no mising records when checked against AGM's `customers` table, and any mismatches were results of misspellings that could easily be corrected. Therefore, since we are able to match records from both the AGM and Peak customer tables (i.e. we are not suffering from data loss), I recommend that we continue to withhold the customer data from 3rd party sales channels."
